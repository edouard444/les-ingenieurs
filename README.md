#Application idea:

#LuxAuto – A platform connecting buyers and sellers of cars worldwide

#General description:

-The LuxAuto Connect application has a dual purpose:

#1️⃣ For buyers - It allows anyone, wherever they are in Haiti, to view available vehicles (photos, technical details, price, location), compare options, and get in direct contact with the seller through the application (chat, call, WhatsApp).

#2️⃣ For sellers - The application also allows users, depending on their level of experience or subscription, to become official sellers on the platform, publish their cars, manage ads, receive messages and close sales.

#Problem identified:

-In Haiti, it is often difficult to:

-Buyers → to find reliable cars, check prices, or contact good sellers.

-Sellers → to display their vehicles to a wide audience, without spending on advertising or travel.

#Proposed solution:

-LuxAuto Connect creates a digital bridge between car buyers and sellers in Haiti, thanks to: ✔ A centralized platform -Photos + details + price + location -Direct contact between seller and buyer -Opportunity to become a seller based on experience (level/subscription)

#User testimonials:

-I always had to go out to look for cars, now I can see everything on my phone, and I can contact the owner directly." "As a small seller, the application helps me sell faster without having to advertise on Facebook."
